# study
All the files are written by Yusof(me), a math major. I know I am far from an expert of any area concerning computer science, but I still want to write down everything
I have learned. I am planning on explaining some basic machine learning algorithms mathematically along with the code to achive them. Besides, I may craete a section 
particularly for mathematics, including linear algebra, functional analysis and differential geometry. Basically the mathematics section is just a concise version of my
notes.
