# study

Hello, I'm Yusof, a math major at Chongqing University in his third year.


I'm currently learning basic machine leaning algorithms. As a way of enhancing my memory for the knowledge of this part, I will try to 
introduce the mathematical backgrouds of these algorithms and implement them by myself using Python.


Moreover, I'm also learning communication theory so I will try to implement some algorithms in this area using C.


Finally. As a math major, I may introduce some useful or beautiful theories in mathematics. Basically it is just uploading a part of my
notes for functional analysis and differential geometry.


These are the three things I want to do.


Hope I can do it. Fingers crossed haha.
